# CS211GroupProjct
Group Project I did with several partners making a software to take in two addresses and give the user a list of locations to meet in the middle.
During the course of this project, I was in charge of making requests to google maps api services and parsing the returned data to get the information needed.
I also worked on the data storage structures that handled the stored information on stores and resturants to be displayed by the GUI.
